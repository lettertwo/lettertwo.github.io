## Experience

### Atlassian — Senior Software Engineer

#### **Austin, TX (remote)** | 2023-2025

> Atlassian is a leading provider of collaboration and productivity software, serving millions of users worldwide. Their products include Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket, and more.

Platform engineering on the growth-oriented team owning the atlassian.com web presence. Worked cross-team and cross-org on driving platform initiatives and directly contributed implementations spanning many thousands of pages that saw millions of views every day and drove as much as $1B in revenue annually.

**Notable contributions:**

- Collaborated on design and implementation of an experimentation platform for testing and measuring infrastructure changes
- Optimized bundling for sharing runtime code across thousands of pages, which improved core web vital metrics by 30% or more, and improved CI build and local dev loop times by up to 60%
- Overhauled legacy and ad-hoc data integrations to use the Relay framework and GraphQL, which improved core web vitals for data-heavy experiences by as much as 30%
- Implemented streaming server-side rendering (React) and an 'early flush' solution for initiating browser load of critical assets in parallel with server rendering, which improved core web vitals across the board by 20% or more

### Atlassian — Senior Frontend Engineer

#### **San Francisco, CA (remote)** | 2021-2023

Technical lead for the frontend bundler team, focused on performance and reliability. Collaborated with internal product teams on scaling the frontend build tooling to the largest products, and with external teams as a core contributor to the open source bundler Parcel.

**Notable contributions:**

- Designed and implemented shared memory graph data structures optimized for parallelism via NodeJS worker threads, which reduced both memory overhead and cache size on disk by over 50% and reduced time writing to cache by over 5%
- Collaborated on a hybrid build cache using LMDB for data storage and the file system for large build artifacts
- Designed and implemented a DSL for easily sketching file-system-like test inputs and scenarios without requiring a real file system
- Collaborated with product teams to migrate large codebases to Parcel, which improved build times by up to 70% and runtime performance by up to 40%

### HZ — Principal Architect

#### **Rockville, MD** | 2018-2021

Concentration in motion graphics and design. Developed a dynamic Flash application for senior thesis that interfaced with a remote server written in MAX/MSP to create an interactive video installation.

## About

I'm passionate about the intersection of engineering and design, bringing a unique perspective that combines technical expertise with a foundation in interaction and motion design. My background in digital art informs how I approach UI development. I care as much about how things feel as how they perform.

I'm particularly interested in:

- **Performance optimization** - Finding creative solutions to make web applications faster and more efficient
- **User experience** - Building intuitive, accessible interfaces that delight users
- **Developer experience** - Creating tools and infrastructure that make other engineers more productive
- **Agentic AI** - Actively exploring the new ways of working it enables, and what that means for the craft of software engineering
- **Open source collaboration** - Contributing to and learning from the broader development community

Outside of programming, I like music and gaming. I studied cello for many years, and I like playing guitar. I also love Tetris.
